## **This the staring of my journey in Rust**

## **I've made my first Rust program which is a guessing game.**

### *Here first the program generated a random number from 1 to 100. Then ask the user to input a number.*

### *I've learned to tackled various situations like pasrsing, why to use trim when parsing and use of 'Match' and 'Ordering'.*
